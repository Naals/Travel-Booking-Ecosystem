## Tier 3 in progress (1 of 5)
user-service is the first engagement-tier service: profile, travel
preferences, saved locations, and a travel-history projection sourced
from booking-service. SavedLocationAddedEvent is published with no
current consumer, intentionally, for Tier 4's recommendation-service.
